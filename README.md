# Automated File Organizer  

File Organizer is a Python script that helps you automatically organize files in a directory based on their file types. It creates folders for different file types such as PDFs, videos, audios, images, Word documents, ZIP files, and PowerPoint presentations, and moves the files to their respective folders.

# Usage  

Run the script by executing the Python file file_organizer.py.  

Enter the path of the directory you want to organize when prompted.  

Confirm if you want to proceed with the operation to change the location of current files.  

The script will create folders for different file types if they don't exist already, and move the files to their respective folders.  

After the operation is completed, the script will display the number of files organized in each category.  

# Supported File Types  

The script supports the following file types and organizes them into corresponding folders:  

PDFs  

Videos (MP4, M4A)  

Audios (MP3)  

Images (JPEG, JPG, PNG, WEBP)  

Word Documents (DOCX, DOC)  

ZIP Files  

PowerPoint Presentations (PPTX, PPT)  

# Note  

Make sure to backup your files before running the script, as it will change the location of the files.  

The script only moves files with the supported file types. Other file types will not be moved.  

If a folder for a specific file type already exists in the directory, the script will move the files into that folder. If not, it will create a new folder for that file type.  

Happy organizing!
