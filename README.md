# Automated File Organizer  

File Organizer is a Python script that helps you automatically organize files in a directory based on their file types. It creates folders for different file types such as PDFs, videos, audios, images, Word documents, ZIP files, and PowerPoint presentations, and moves the files to their respective folders. This allows you to keep your files neat and accessible. 

# How to Use  

Run the script in a Python environment (e.g. Python interpreter or IDE).  

Follow the prompts to enter the path of the directory you want to organize. Make sure to use the appropriate file path format for your operating system (i.e. double backslashes "\" for Windows or forward slashes "/" for macOS and Linux).  

Confirm if you want to proceed with organizing the files in the specified directory.  

The script will automatically create folders for different file types, such as PDFs, videos, audios, images, Word documents, ZIPs, and Powerpoints, if they do not already exist in the specified directory.  

The script will then move the corresponding files into their respective folders based on their file extensions.  

Once the files are organized, the script will display the total number of files for each file type.  

You can now easily access and manage your files in the organized folders.  

# Supported File Types  

The script supports the following file types and organizes them into corresponding folders:  

PDFs  

Videos (MP4, M4A)  

Audios (MP3)  

Images (JPEG, JPG, PNG, WEBP)  

Word Documents (DOCX, DOC)  

ZIP Files  

PowerPoint Presentations (PPTX, PPT)  

If you have other file types that you want to organize, you can easily modify the script by adding or modifying the corresponding file extensions in the code.

# Note  

Make sure to backup your files before running the script, as it will change the location of the files.  

The script only moves files with the supported file types. Other file types will not be moved.  

If a folder for a specific file type already exists in the directory, the script will move the files into that folder. If not, it will create a new folder for that file type.  

Happy organizing!
